# Introduction

This is the beginnings of the gender simulation in the workplace code

# Running the model

- The model runs using python 2.7 and requires only standard libraries, pandas and numpy

- To run the model from the command line, you need to provide several arguments:

```
python model.py [path to experiment file] [path to default params file] [path to desired output folder] [n_replications_per_condition] [n_cores] [random seed]
```

- ```path to experiment file``` - Path to a file describing experimental parameters.  There is an example in ```experiment.yaml```
- ```path to default params file``` - Path to the default parameters for the model. An example is ```default_params.yaml```
- ```path to desired output folder``` - Where the output is located. See ```R/plot_results.R``` for an example of how to plot the results
- ```n_replications_per_condition``` - How many replications per simulation?
- ```n_cores``` - how many cores you want to use to run the simulation (1 if you're not sure)
- ```random seed``` - a random seed for the model (using the same seed over and over again should replicate your results)

An example command to run the model and replicate (I hope) ```R/boost_diff.R```:

```python model.py experiment.yaml default_params.yaml output 20 4 0```

# Todo

- Actually give some better documentation on the model and how to change it and what the parameters are
- Better installation and usage code and explanations
- Other potential factors (e.g. the likeability stuff)
